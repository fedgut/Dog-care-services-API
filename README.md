## About The Project

[![asciicast][product-screenshot]](https://www.loom.com/share/1fa671b5e0584f3f82b0c27e9640cc54)

This API matches dog care services (Dog sitting, walking, grooming, etc.) with different users!
Many sellers can offer the same service, but who do you trust to care for your furry friend? 
Add those services you prefer to your favorites and easily keep track of them.


This is the final Capstone project of the Microverse Curriculum.

### Documentation

The [documentation]() was built using raddocs 

### Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites

Install RVM

### Setup

Install gems with:

```
bundle install
```

Setup database with:

```
rails db:migrate
```

### Usage

Start server with:

```
rails server
```

Install [httpie](https://httpie.org/) 

#### Signup

The following command will create an login a new user in the database, fill in your name, email and password

```bash
$ http :3000/v1/signup name=Eduardo email=eduardo@email.com password=foobar password_confirmation=foobar
```
#### Login

Users Log in with their email and password

```bash
$ http :3000/v1/login email=eduardo@email.com password=foobar
```

#### Register a service

Only Admins can register a service! We do this to guarantee all dog handlers have insurance and are properly identified. 

To add services locally open a rails console and update the user you want to set as admin this way:

```bash
$ rails c
> User.find_by(email: 'eduardo@email.com').update(admin: true)
> exit
```
After that login the user and keep the auth_token safe!

```bash
$ http :3000/login email=eduardo@email.com password=foobar
```

Finally we'll create a new service this way (paste the auth_token in the Authorization header)

```bash
$ http :3000/services name=grooming user_id=1 \
Authorization:'paste your auth token here'
```

#### Services index

To see all the services available 

```bash
$ http :3000/services
```

#### To see the details of a Service

Once you have seen the list of all services, choose and and type in the id in place of the *:id* too see its details.

```bash
$ http :3000/service/:id
```
#### Create Favorite 

To create a favorite login the user (admin or not) and keep the auth_token safe
```bash
$ http :3000/login email=youremail@email.com password=foobar
```
Now we'll enter the service_id and the Authentication header

```bash
$ http :3000/users/2/favorites service_id=1 \
Authorization:'yourtoken'
```
#### All Favorites

To see all your favorites you must log in, we'll use the same authentication steps as before

```bash
$ http :3000/users/2/favourites Authorization:'yourtoken'
```
